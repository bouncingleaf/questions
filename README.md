Questions full stack app

## What is this?
This is an app based on the application built during the Pluralsight course 
"Building a full stack app with React and Express". 
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-express-full-stack-app-building

## Lessons learned along the way:
### 1. Encountered two children with the same key

This bug was so clear in hindsight:

    Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, `{group.id}`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates.

I had key="{groupId}" instead of key={groupId} (it shouldn't have quotation marks). 

### 2. When to use curly braces on import?

I realized as I was following along with the Pluralsight tutorial that I didn't know why the presenter was sometimes using curly braces at import and sometimes not. Here's a good explanation: http://2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html

### 3. Router

The tutorial doesn't really explain what "match" is or where it comes from (used in TaskDetail.jsx). I found a pretty good page on it (and other features of React's Router) here:
