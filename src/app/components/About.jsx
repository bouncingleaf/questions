      This is an app based on the application built during the Pluralsight course 
      "<a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-express-full-stack-app-building">
        Building a full stack app with React and Express
      </a>". 
    </p>
    <p>
      My intent was to just go through the tutorial, pick up the information about how to connect the front and back end, maybe learn a little about authentication, and then move on.
    I really should have known that I was a) going to love learning React too much to give that up, and b) going to run into some completely bizarre bug at the last moment that would derail me for several days.
